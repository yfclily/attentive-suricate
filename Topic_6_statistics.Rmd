## Descriptive statistics

Open our `students` data set in Excel and R. Do you know about pivot table in excel? Obviously, the same can be accomplished in R. 

```{r,  eval=T}
students<-read.table('https://www.dipintothereef.com/uploads/3/7/3/5/37359245/students.txt',header=T, sep="\t", dec='.') # inspect the object created

write.table(students, file = "Data/students.txt", sep = "\t", row.names=T)
```

Make a quick `summary` of our data set in R.

```{r,  eval=T}
summary(students)
```

A more detailed summary can be obtained using the function `describe` from the package `psych`.

```{r,  eval=T}
describe(students)
```

The function `describeBy` provides a group-wise summary of the dataset.

```{r,  eval=T}
describeBy (students,students$gender)
describeBy (students, list(students$gender,students$population))
```


### Count and proportion

Simple tabulation (count) summary are made using`table`

```{r,  eval=T}
# One variables
table(students$gender)
prop.table (table(students$gender))

# two variables
table(students$gender, students$shoesize)
prop.table (table(students$gender, students$shoesize))

# three variables, with nicer formatting
ftable(students$gender, students$shoesize,students$population)
```

### `mean`, `median`, `sd`, etc.

You already know how to apply basic function on a vector, create a filter and use it on a subgroup:

```{r,  eval=T}
mean(students$height)
ind.male <- students$gender == 'male'
mean(students$height[ind.male])
```

**IMPORTANT FUNCTIONS** Common descriptive statistics can be combined in the `aggregate` and `apply` functions. The 'big' difference between the two is  that  the second argument of `aggregate` must be a list while `tapply` can (not mandatory) be a list and that the output of `aggregate` is a data frame while the one of `tapply` is an array.   

```{r,  eval=T}
aggregate(students$height,list (students$gender),median)
tapply(students$height,students$gender, median)
```

The wide family of `apply` functions often represents an alternative to loops. You can read more about these functions online.

  geom_boxplot()
  
plot2 <-ggplot(iris, aes(x=Species, y=Sepal.Width)) + 
  geom_boxplot() 
  
plot3 <-ggplot(iris, aes(x=Species, y=Petal.Length)) + 
  geom_boxplot() 
  
plot4 <-ggplot(iris, aes(x=Species, y=Petal.Width)) + 
  geom_boxplot() 
  
grid.arrange(plot1, plot2,plot3, plot4, ncol=2)
describeBy (iris, iris$Species)


iris %>% group_by(Species) %>% summarise_each(list(length))
aggregate(iris[,1:4],by=list(iris$Species), median)
tapply(iris$Sepal.Length , iris$Species, mean)
```



## Statistical testing

Two broad categories: parametric (assuming normal distrbution & homoscedasticity) and non parametric (no assumption of normality).The most important is your **hypothesis**: *H0* represents the null hypothesis - an absence of difference (does not mean there is no difference), *H1* represents the alternative hypothesis - the presence of difference.

### Correlations

Let's first examine what is a correlation. It looks scary but it is actually very easy. 

![](Figures/corr.png)

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
# dataset 
x<-students$height
y<-students$shoesize
s<-students[,1:2] # a matrix
# Pearson correlation
# cor(x,y)
# cor(s)
cor.test(x,y)
```

This relationship is usually represented with it confident interval on a scatter plot.

```{r,  eval=T}
ggplot(students, aes(x = height, y = shoesize)) + 
  geom_point() +
  stat_smooth(method = "lm", col = "red")
```

This is a *Pearson* correlation (parametric). Non-parametric alterantives also exists such as the *Spearman*. It is based on rank, and monotonic relationship.

```{r,  eval=T}
# Spearman correlation (monotonic)
# cor(x,y, method ='spearman')
cor.test(x,y, method ='spearman')
```

The example below illustrates on the importance of running both types of correlation. 

```{r,  eval=F}
w<-(1:100)
z<-exp(x)
cor.test(w,z,method='pearson') # super low
cor.test(w,z,method='spearman') #super high
```

### Chi-square test

It is a goodness-of-fit test. Easier to understand with an example:

![](Figures/die.png)

```{r,  eval=T}
#Cast 240 times a die. We counted occurence of 1,2,3,4,5,6
die<-data.frame(obs=c(55,44,35,45,31,30), row.names=c('Cast1','Cast2','Cast3','Cast4','Cast5','Cast6'))
die #Is this die fair? Define H0 and H1.  
```

Assumption: all results are equally probably (H0, uniform distribution).

```{r,  eval=T}
chisq.test(die)
# I am cheating
```

A common biological application of a Chi-square test is the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. Genotypes at the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium will follow: p2 + 2pq +q2 = 1 when panmixia (random matin, p and q represent allele frequency). In this case, we want to compare our observation to a theoretical distribution.

Let's assume 2 alleles (A and T) with observed genotypes in a population: 750 AA, 50 AT, 200 TT => f(A): 0.775 / f(T)= 0.225. Theoretical distribution should follow: 0.60(p2), 0.5 (2pq), 0.05 (q2) with p2 + 2pq +q2 = 1. Is our population at the HW-equilibrium (H0)?

```{r,  eval=T}
obs <- c(750, 50, 200)
exp <- c(0.60, 0.35, 0.05)
chisq.test (x=obs, p=exp)
```

Chi-square test can simply be used to compare the distribution of frequencies in two populations: 
```{r,  eval=T}
F <- matrix(nrow=4,ncol=2,data=c(33,14, 8,18,31,25,14,12))
chisq.test(F) # alternative see `fisher.test`
```

### Student t-test

Several version: one sample compared to a known mean, two samples (with variance equal - Student's or with unequal variance -Welsh's), paired (compare two dependent (e.g. before-after) samples. 

```{r,  eval=T}
# One sample
t.test (students$height, mu=170)
# Two sample (with equal variances)
t.test (students$height~students$gender, var.equal = TRUE)
# Two sample (with unequal variances, default option when using t.test) 
t.test (students$height~students$gender)
# Two sample paired t.test
t.test (students$height~students$gender, paired=T)
```

The *t* statistic is obtained as following in the case of a two samples assuming equal variances:

![](Figures/ttest.png)

> *<span style="color: green">**RP13**: Using `iris`. Does `Sepal.Lenght` differ between `setosa` and `versicolor`? Does `Sepal.Lenght` differe between `virginica`  and `versicolor`? Make a plot, define your hypotheses, test them. </span>* 

```{r class.source = "fold-hide",  eval=F}
set <- iris[iris$Species == "setosa", ]$Sepal.Length
ver <- iris[iris$Species == "versicolor", ]$Sepal.Length
vir <- iris[iris$Species == "virginica", ]$Sepal.Length

setver <- t.test(set, ver, paired = FALSE, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
vervir <- t.test(ver, vir, paired = FALSE, alternative = "two.sided", var.equal = FALSE)
```

### Mann-Whitney and Wilcoxon tests

A non-parametric solution for the comparison of two samples: Mann-Whitney U-test (independent) or Wilcoxon W-test (dependant)

```{r class.source = "fold-show",  eval=T}
# Normality plot & test
students$height[6]<-132
students$height[10]<-310
students$height[8]<-132
students$height[9]<-210
boxplot(height~gender, students)
qqnorm(students$height) 
qqline(students$height) 
shapiro.test(students$height) # data are not normal 
wilcox.test (students$height~students$gender) 
```

### Variance tests

Variance tests are used to determine if the variances of two (or more) populations are equal. F-test are generally very sensitive to the non-normality of the data as you can imagine from the previous `boxplot`. The **homoscedasticity** (or homogeneity of variance) is an important condition in parametric statistics.

```{r Fligner test, eval=T}
# Test of variance: we test HO: homogenous, H1:heterogenous
fligner.test (students$height ~ students$gender)
```

Another example using the `ToothGrowth` dataset (`car` package) on multiple groups


```{r ToothGrowth, eval=T}
tg<-ToothGrowth
tg$dose<-factor(tg$dose)
boxplot(len~dose*supp, data=tg)
# also work with: boxplot(len ~ interaction (dose,supp), data=tg)
# or: plot(len ~ interaction (dose,supp), data=tg)
bartlett.test(len~interaction (supp,dose),data=ToothGrowth) # sensitivity non-normality +++
leveneTest(len~interaction (supp,dose),data=ToothGrowth) # sensitivity non-normality ++
fligner.test(len~interaction (supp,dose),data=ToothGrowth) # sensitivity non-normality +
```
